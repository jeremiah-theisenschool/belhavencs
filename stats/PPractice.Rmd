```{r}
names(chickwts)
``` 
## P1 
1. 
a. 
```{r}
length(which(chickwts$feed=="soybean"))
length(which(chickwts$feed=="meatmeal"))
``` 
b. P(M) = 11/71 = 0.155
P(S) = 14/71 = 0.197

c. 
```{r}
index = sample(1:nrow(chickwts), 20)
samp=chickwts[index,]
table(samp$feed)
``` 
d. P(M) = 5/20 = 0.25
P(S) = 4/20 = 0.2 

e. The sample has a higher proportion of both. 

## P2 
2. 
a. 26/52 => 1/2 
b. 16/52 => 4/13
c. 8/52 
d. P(R) = 26/52, P(F) = 16/52. P(R) * P(F) = 416/2704 = 8/52 = P(R and F) = 8/52. P(A|B) = (8/52)/(16/52) = 8/52 * 52/16 => 8/16 => 1/2 = P(R).
