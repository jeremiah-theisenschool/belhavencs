## 7.1.1
```{r}
possum = read.csv("https://github.com/TienChih/tbil-stats/raw/main/data/possum.csv")

names(possum)
``` 

a.
```{r}
plot(possum$skull_w, possum$head_l, pch=19)
```
b.The 62mm skull would be predicted to have a longer head 

c.53mm skull would be around 87mm long. 62mm skull would be around 96mm long. I would feel fairly confident that they would line up that way, but the exact numbers would be off by a bit.  

d.55mm. Very confident because there seems to be a large cluster at 55mm. 

## 7.1.2 
a. c and f have strong linear relationships. 

## 7.1.3
a. R = 0.35
b. R = -0.97
c. R = 0 
d. R = 0.65
e. R = -0.38
f. R = -0.85
g. R = 0.99
h. the same graph as f. 
i. R = 0.85

## 7.1.4
I would say (b) is the best fit 

## 7.1.5 
a.

b. It fits a lot better than it did before.
